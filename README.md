# dotfiles
This is the repository to host all of my dotfiles, which mainly consists 
of my vimrc. The initial configuration for my vimrc is based on the
configuration for Vundle.vim found [here](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim).  
Please feel free to any dotfiles on this repo as a basis for your own
configurations.

## Feedback
If you see any potential improvements to the configurations found here, please feel free
to submit a pull request.
